---

1. AI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a product presenting a risk defined in Article 3, point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 insofar as risks to the health or safety or to the protection of fundamental rights of persons are concerned.

2. Where the [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) of a Member State has sufficient reasons to consider that an AI system presents a risk as referred to in paragraph 1, they shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. When risks to the protection of fundamental rights are present, the [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) shall also inform the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred to in Article 641. . The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities and the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in Article 641. .

	Where, in the course of that evaluation, the [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) finds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without delay require the relevant [operator](operator.html) to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.

	The [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) shall inform the relevant [notified body](notified body.html) accordingly. Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second subparagraph.

3. Where the [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) considers that non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the [operator](operator.html) to take.

4. The [operator](operator.html) shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the AI systems concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union.

5. Where the [operator](operator.html) of an AI system does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in paragraph 2, the [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the AI system's being made available on its national market, to withdraw the product from that market or to recall it. That authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures.

6. The information referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant AI system, the origin of the AI system, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant [operator](operator.html). In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to one or more of the following:

	1. {a}(a)a failure of the AI system to meet requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2;
	2. (b)shortcomings in the harmonised standards or [common specifications](common specifications.html) referred to in Articles 40 and 41 conferring a presumption of conformity.

3. The market surveillance authorities of the Member States other than the [market surveillance authority](market surveillance authority.html) of the Member State initiating the procedure shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the AI system concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections.

8. Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 5, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. This is without prejudice to the procedural rights of the concerned [operator](operator.html) in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020.

9. The market surveillance authorities of all Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken in respect of the product concerned, such as withdrawal of the product from their market, without delay.
