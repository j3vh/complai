#### Article 5

1. The following artificial intelligence practices shall be prohibited:

	1. {a}(a)the [placing on the market](placing on the market.html), [putting into service](putting into service.html)  or use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness in order to materially distort a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm;
	2. (b)the [placing on the market](placing on the market.html), [putting into service](putting into service.html) or use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons due to their age, physical or mental disability, in order to materially distort the behaviour of a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or [[[[[[[putting into service]([[[[[[[[putting into service.html)]([[[[[[[putting into service]([[[[[[[[putting into service.html).html)]([[[[[[putting into service]([[[[[[[[putting into service.html)]([[[[[[[putting into service]([[[[[[[[putting into service.html).html).html)]]|psychological harm;
3. (c)the [placing on the market](placing on the market.html), [putting into service](putting into service.html) or use of AI systems by public authorities or on their behalf for the evaluation or classification of the trustworthiness of natural persons over a certain period of time based on their social behaviour or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with the social score leading to either or both of the following:
		1. (i)detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts which are unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally generated or collected;
		2. (ii)detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity;
	4. (d)the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of [law enforcement](law enforcement.html), unless and in as far as such use is strictly necessary for one of the following objectives:
		1. (i)the targeted search for specific potential victims of crime, including missing children;
		2. (ii)the prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack;
		3. (iii)the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of a perpetrator or suspect of a criminal offence referred to in Article 21.  of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA [62](app://obsidian.md/index.html#footnote63) and punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years, as determined by the law of that Member State.

2. The use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of [law enforcement](law enforcement.html) for any of the objectives referred to in paragraph 1 point d) shall take into account the following elements:
	1. {a}(a)the nature of the situation giving rise to the possible use, in particular the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm caused in the absence of the use of the system;
	2. (b)the consequences of the use of the system for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned, in particular the seriousness, probability and scale of those consequences.''
	In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of [law enforcement](law enforcement.html) for any of the objectives referred to in paragraph 1 point d) shall comply with necessary and proportionate safeguards and conditions in relation to the use, in particular as regards the temporal, geographic and personal limitations.
	
3. As regards paragraphs 1, point (d) and 2, each individual use for the purpose of [[law enforcement]([[law enforcement.html)|[law enforceme](law enforceme.html)nt]([law enforcement]([[law enforcement.html)|[law enforceme](law enforceme.html)nt.html) of a [‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system](‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system.html) in publicly accessible spaces shall be subject to a prior authorisation granted by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of the Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 4. However, in a duly justified situation of urgency, the use of the system may be commenced without an authorisation and the authorisation may be requested only during or after the use.
	The competent judicial or administrative authority shall only grant the authorisation where it is satisfied, based on objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ [remote biometric identification system](remote biometric identification system.html) at issue is necessary for and proportionate to achieving one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, point (d), as identified in the request. In deciding on the request, the competent judicial or administrative authority shall take into account the elements referred to in paragraph 2.

4. A Member State may decide to provide for the possibility to fully or partially authorise the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of [law enforcement](law enforcement.html) within the limits and under the conditions listed in paragraphs 1, point (d), 2 and 3. That Member State shall lay down in its national law the necessary detailed rules for the request, issuance and exercise of, as well as supervision relating to, the authorisations referred to in paragraph 3. Those rules shall also specify in respect of which of the objectives listed in paragraph 1, point (d), including which of the criminal offences referred to in point (iii) thereof, the competent authorities may be authorised to use those systems for the purpose of [law enforcement](law enforcement.html).
