1. A risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to [high-risk AI systems](high-risk AI systems.html).

2. The risk management system shall consist of a continuous iterative process run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic updating. It shall comprise the following steps:

	1. {a}(a)identification and analysis of the known and foreseeable risks associated with each high-risk AI system;
	2. (b)estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its [intended purpose](intended purpose.html) and under conditions of [reasonably foreseeable misuse](reasonably foreseeable misuse.html);
	3. (c)evaluation of other possibly arising risks based on the analysis of data gathered from the [post-market monitoring](post-market monitoring.html) system referred to in Article 61;
	4. (d)adoption of suitable risk management measures in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs.

3. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interactions resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Chapter 2. They shall take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art, including as reflected in relevant harmonised standards or [common specifications](common specifications.html).

4. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall be such that any residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk of the [high-risk AI systems](high-risk AI systems.html) is judged acceptable, provided that the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its [intended purpose](intended purpose.html) or under conditions of [[reasonably foreseeable misuse]([[reasonably foreseeable misuse.html)|[reasonably foreseeable misu](reasonably foreseeable misu.html)se|[reasonably foreseeable misu](reasonably foreseeable misu.html)se]([reasonably foreseeable misuse]([[reasonably foreseeable misuse.html)|[reasonably foreseeable misu](reasonably foreseeable misu.html)se|[reasonably foreseeable misu](reasonably foreseeable misu.html)se.html). Those residual risks shall be communicated to the [user](user.html).
	In identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured:
	1. {a}(a)elimination or reduction of risks as far as possible through adequate design and development;
	2. (b)where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated;
	3. (c)provision of adequate information pursuant to Article 13, in particular as regards the risks referred to in paragraph 2, point (b) of this Article, and, where appropriate, training to users.
	In eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education, training to be expected by the [user](user.html) and the environment in which the system is intended to be used.

5. [High-risk AI systems](High-risk AI systems.html) shall be tested for the purposes of identifying the most appropriate risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that [high-risk AI systems](high-risk AI systems.html) perform consistently for their [intended purpose](intended purpose.html) and they are in compliance with the requirements set out in this Chapter.

6. Testing procedures shall be suitable to achieve the [intended purpose](intended purpose.html) of the AI system and do not need to go beyond what is necessary to achieve that purpose.

7. The testing of the [high-risk AI systems](high-risk AI systems.html) shall be performed, as appropriate, at any point in time throughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to the [placing on the market](placing on the market.html) or the [putting into service](putting into service.html). Testing shall be made against preliminarily defined metrics and probabilistic thresholds that are appropriate to the [intended purpose](intended purpose.html) of the high-risk AI system.

8. When implementing the risk management system described in paragraphs 1 to 7, specific consideration shall be given to whether the high-risk AI system is likely to be accessed by or have an impact on children.

9. For credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU, the aspects described in paragraphs 1 to 8 shall be part of the risk management procedures established by those institutions pursuant to Article 74 of that Directive.
