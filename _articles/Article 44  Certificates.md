1. Certificates issued by notified bodies in accordance with Annex VII shall be drawn-up in an official Union language determined by the Member State in which the [notified body](notified body.html) is established or in an official Union language otherwise acceptable to the [notified body](notified body.html).

2. Certificates shall be valid for the period they indicate, which shall not exceed five years. On application by the [provider](provider.html), the validity of a certificate may be extended for further periods, each not exceeding five years, based on a re-assessment in accordance with the applicable [conformity assessment](conformity assessment.html) procedures.

3. Where a [notified body](notified body.html) finds that an AI system no longer meets the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend or withdraw the certificate issued or impose any restrictions on it, unless compliance with those requirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the [provider](provider.html) of the system within an appropriate deadline set by the [notified body](notified body.html). The [notified body](notified body.html) shall give reasons for its decision.
